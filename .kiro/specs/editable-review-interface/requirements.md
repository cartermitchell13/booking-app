# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the current multi-step offering creation wizard into a streamlined, editable review interface where users can see exactly what their offering will look like to customers and edit it inline. This approach eliminates the complexity of managing multiple form steps and state synchronization by providing a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editing experience that directly mirrors the customer-facing view.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner creating an offering, I want to see exactly how my offering will appear to customers while I'm editing it, so that I can make informed decisions about content and presentation without switching between forms and previews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts creating a new offering THEN the system SHALL display a customer-facing preview layout with editable sections
2. WHEN a user clicks on any editable section THEN the system SHALL show inline editing controls without changing the overall layout
3. WHEN a user makes changes to content THEN the system SHALL update the preview in real-time
4. WHEN a user views the interface THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which sections are editable through visual cues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to edit offering details directly within the customer preview, so that I can efficiently create and modify my offering without navigating through multiple form steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the offering title THEN the system SHALL provide an inline text editor
2. WHEN a user clicks on the description THEN the system SHALL provide a rich text editor for formatting
3. WHEN a user clicks on pricing information THEN the system SHALL show pricing configuration controls
4. WHEN a user clicks on images THEN the system SHALL provide image upload and management tools
5. WHEN a user clicks on scheduling information THEN the system SHALL show scheduling configuration options
6. WHEN a user clicks on location details THEN the system SHALL provide location selection and configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to automatically save my changes as I edit, so that I don't lose my work and can continue editing later without manual save actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes any change to offering content THEN the system SHALL automatically save the change within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user's internet connection is interrupted THEN the system SHALL queue changes and sync when connection is restored
3. WHEN a user returns to editing an offering THEN the system SHALL restore all previously saved changes
4. WHEN auto-save occurs THEN the system SHALL provide subtle visual feedback to confirm the save

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to configure advanced settings without leaving the preview interface, so that I can maintain context while setting up complex offering features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs to configure product-specific settings THEN the system SHALL provide contextual panels that overlay the preview
2. WHEN a user configures pickup locations THEN the system SHALL show these immediately in the customer preview
3. WHEN a user sets up amenities THEN the system SHALL display them in the "What's Included" section instantly
4. WHEN a user configures pricing tiers THEN the system SHALL update the booking sidebar pricing display

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want validation and publishing controls integrated into the editable interface, so that I can complete the entire offering creation process without switching contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL highlight those sections with clear visual indicators
2. WHEN a user attempts to publish an incomplete offering THEN the system SHALL show validation errors inline within the preview
3. WHEN an offering is ready to publish THEN the system SHALL provide publishing options directly within the interface
4. WHEN validation errors exist THEN the system SHALL prevent publishing and guide users to incomplete sections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the editable interface to work seamlessly across different device sizes, so that I can create and edit offerings from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the interface on mobile THEN the system SHALL adapt editing controls for touch interaction
2. WHEN a user switches between desktop and mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain editing state and functionality
3. WHEN editing on smaller screens THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential editing controls and hide secondary features
4. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets for all interactive elements
