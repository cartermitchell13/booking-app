# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing date picker component on the home page to match the sophisticated design and functionality of Booking.com's date picker. The current implementation uses basic HTML date inputs, but users need a more intuitive and visually appealing calendar interface that displays two months side by side, allows easy date range selection, and provides better visual feedback for selected dates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user searching for trips, I want to see a visual calendar interface when selecting dates, so that I can easily browse available dates and select my preferred travel period.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on the date picker field THEN the system SHALL display a calendar popup with two months visible side by side
2. WHEN the calendar opens THEN the system SHALL show the current month and the next month by default
3. WHEN the user clicks outside the calendar popup THEN the system SHALL close the calendar interface
4. WHEN the calendar is open THEN the system SHALL prevent scrolling of the background page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between months in the calendar, so that I can select dates from future months beyond the initially displayed range.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the previous month arrow THEN the system SHALL shift both months backward by one month
2. WHEN the user clicks the next month arrow THEN the system SHALL shift both months forward by one month
3. WHEN viewing past months THEN the system SHALL disable dates that are before today's date
4. WHEN the user navigates to different months THEN the system SHALL maintain any previously selected date range

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select a date range by clicking start and end dates, so that I can easily specify my travel period without typing dates manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on an available date THEN the system SHALL set it as the start date and highlight it with the primary brand color
2. WHEN the user clicks on a second date after selecting a start date THEN the system SHALL set it as the end date if it's after the start date
3. WHEN the user hovers over dates after selecting a start date THEN the system SHALL show a preview of the potential date range
4. WHEN a complete date range is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight all dates in the range with a lighter background color
5. WHEN the user clicks on a new start date while a range is already selected THEN the system SHALL clear the previous selection and start a new range

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the date picker to display clearly which dates are selected and which are in my range, so that I can easily see my selection before confirming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a start date is selected THEN the system SHALL display it with a rounded background in the primary brand color
2. WHEN an end date is selected THEN the system SHALL display it with a rounded background in the primary brand color
3. WHEN dates are in the selected range THEN the system SHALL display them with a light background color connecting the start and end dates
4. WHEN today's date is visible THEN the system SHALL display it with a subtle border or indicator
5. WHEN dates are unavailable (in the past) THEN the system SHALL display them with reduced opacity and disable click interactions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the date picker to be responsive and work well on mobile devices, so that I can easily select dates regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a single month view instead of two months side by side
2. WHEN on mobile THEN the system SHALL make the calendar full-width and touch-friendly with larger touch targets
3. WHEN on tablet devices THEN the system SHALL maintain the two-month layout but adjust sizing appropriately
4. WHEN the calendar is open on mobile THEN the system SHALL position it to avoid keyboard overlap

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the date picker to integrate seamlessly with the existing search bar design, so that it maintains the visual consistency of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the date picker is closed THEN the system SHALL display the selected date range in the same format as the current implementation
2. WHEN no dates are selected THEN the system SHALL show the placeholder text "Add dates"
3. WHEN the calendar popup opens THEN the system SHALL use the tenant's branding colors for highlights and selections
4. WHEN dates are selected THEN the system SHALL update the search bar display immediately without requiring additional clicks
