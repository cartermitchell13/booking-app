# ParkBus Booking Site Development Plan

## Background and Motivation

The client has a marketing site at parkbus.ca built on Webflow with a CMS containing destination data. When users click "Book Now" on the marketing site, they should be redirected to a separate booking application at booking.parkbus.ca. This separation allows for:

- Clear separation of concerns between marketing and booking functionality
- Independent scaling and optimization of each platform
- Better user experience with a dedicated booking flow
- Easier maintenance and updates

**🚀 NEW DIRECTION**: The platform is now being transformed from a single-client solution into a multi-tenant SaaS platform that can be sold to other tour/bus companies. This will require significant architectural changes while preserving the existing functionality for ParkBus.

**🎨 CURRENT FOCUS - December 2024**: With 24 pages built across the platform (super admin, tenant admin, onboarding, and basic customer-facing), the focus has shifted to **enhancing the customer experience** on the booking platform. The goal is to create a best-in-class trip discovery and booking experience that will wow potential SaaS customers and provide a competitive advantage.

**🎯 NEW PRIORITY - December 2024**: **BOOKING FLOW UX ENHANCEMENT** - The user has identified that the booking flow is the main revenue-generating part of the app and needs immediate improvement for better conversion rates.

## Current Technical Stack Analysis

**Existing Setup:**
- Next.js 15.3.3 with React 19
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for backend/database
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Radix UI components for accessible UI elements
- Lucide React for icons

**Existing Components:**
- `date-picker.tsx` - Date selection component
- `location-select.tsx` - Location/destination selector
- `passenger-selector.tsx` - Passenger count selection
- `search-bar.tsx` - Search functionality
- `trip-type-toggle.tsx` - Toggle between trip types

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Data Integration**: How to receive and process booking parameters from the marketing site
2. **Search & Discovery**: Users need to find and select their desired trips
3. **Booking Flow**: Multi-step process from search to payment
4. **State Management**: Managing complex booking state across components
5. **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing
6. **User Management**: Guest checkout vs. registered users
7. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensuring great mobile experience
8. **Performance**: Fast loading and smooth interactions

## Customer Experience Enhancement Analysis - December 2024

**Current Customer-Facing Status**: 4 of 5 essential pages complete (Search, Trip Details, Auth, Account Dashboard)

**Key Experience Gaps Identified**:
1. **Trip Discovery**: Basic search exists but lacks advanced filtering, map integration, and smart recommendations
2. **Visual Appeal**: Limited photo galleries, no 360° views or immersive media
3. **Social Proof**: Missing reviews, ratings, and customer testimonials 
4. **Personalization**: No saved searches, wishlist, or recommendation engine
5. **Booking Conversion**: Basic flow works but could be optimized for higher conversion rates
6. **Mobile Experience**: Functional but not optimized for mobile-first discovery
7. **Real-time Features**: No live availability, pricing updates, or instant notifications

**Competitive Analysis Insights**:
- **Airbnb**: Excellent map-based discovery, wish lists, instant booking
- **Booking.com**: Advanced filters, user reviews, price alerts
- **Viator/GetYourGuide**: Rich media galleries, detailed itineraries, social proof
- **Expedia**: Bundle deals, loyalty programs, personalized recommendations

**Enhancement Opportunities**:
1. **Make trip discovery more engaging and visual**
2. **Add social proof and trust indicators throughout**
3. **Implement smart search and personalization features**
4. **Optimize mobile experience for touch-first interaction**
5. **Add real-time features that create urgency and engagement**

✅ **Business Management**: Trip management, booking management, customer CRM, team management
✅ **SaaS Infrastructure**: Onboarding, billing, branding customization, platform administration

### **🚨 What's Missing: The Actual Revenue-Generating Product**
**The customer-facing booking website where tour operators' customers actually book trips and generate revenue**

**Currently Available Customer Pages (Limited)**:
- ✅ **Homepage** (`/`) - Basic trip search and featured trips
- ✅ **Basic Booking Flow** (`/booking/[tripId]`) - 5-step booking process

**Missing Critical Customer Pages (17+ pages needed)**:
- ❌ **Trip Search Results** (`/search`, `/trips`) - Browse and filter available trips
- ❌ **Trip Detail Pages** (`/trip/[id]`) - Comprehensive trip information before booking
- ❌ **Customer Authentication** (`/login`, `/register`) - Customer accounts and authentication
- ❌ **Customer Dashboard** (`/account/*`) - Personal booking management center (5 sub-pages)
- ❌ **Customer Support** (`/help`, `/contact`, `/faq`) - Self-service support system
- ❌ **Legal Pages** (`/terms`, `/privacy`, `/refund-policy`, etc.) - Required legal compliance (6 pages)

### **Business Impact of Missing Pages**
**Without these customer-facing pages, tour operators cannot:**
1. **Generate Revenue** - No way for customers to discover and book trips beyond the basic flow
2. **Build Trust** - Missing legal pages, support center, and professional trip details
3. **Manage Customers** - No customer accounts, booking history, or self-service options
4. **Scale Operations** - No search/discovery, limited customer support capabilities
5. **Compete Professionally** - Missing standard e-commerce features expected by customers

### **Priority Analysis for Phase 3**

**🔥 HIGHEST PRIORITY (Phase 3.1 - Essential Revenue Generation)**:
1. **Trip Search Results** (`/search`) - Core trip discovery functionality
2. **Trip Detail Pages** (`/trip/[id]`) - Professional trip information and conversion
3. **Customer Authentication** (`/login`, `/register`) - Account creation and management
4. **Customer Dashboard** (`/account`) - Personal booking management center
5. **Basic Support Pages** (`/help`, `/contact`) - Essential customer service

**🔥 HIGH PRIORITY (Phase 3.2 - Trust & Compliance)**:
6. **Legal Pages** (`/terms`, `/privacy`, `/refund-policy`) - Required for business operations
7. **FAQ System** (`/faq`) - Reduce support burden with self-service
8. **Enhanced Booking Flow** - Improve existing booking process with real-time availability

**🔥 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Phase 3.3 - Customer Experience)**:
9. **Trip Categories/Destinations** (`/destinations/[destination]`) - Organized trip browsing
10. **Wishlist/Saved Trips** (`/account/wishlist`) - Customer engagement features
11. **Booking Modifications** - Allow customers to modify existing bookings
12. **Review System** - Customer reviews and ratings for trips

**Next Phase Target**: **Phase 3.1** - Implement the 5 highest priority customer-facing pages to create a functional booking platform that can actually generate revenue for tour operators.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Completed Task: Demo Booking Landing Page

**Key Features**:
- URL parameter handling (`?destination=banff`, `?date=`, `?passengers=`)
- Hero section with destination-specific content and imagery
- Pre-populated search form integration
- Trust indicators for conversion
- Clean, focused booking interface
- Matches existing brand colors and styling

**Demo URLs to show client**:
- `booking.parkbus.ca/book?destination=banff`
- `booking.parkbus.ca/book?destination=jasper`
- `booking.parkbus.ca/book?destination=tofino`

**Success Criteria Met**:
✅ Professional, conversion-focused landing page
✅ URL parameter integration working
✅ Existing search components integrated
✅ Mobile-responsive design
✅ Matches brand aesthetic

**Next Steps**: The demo page is ready to show your client. This should help convince them of the booking.parkbus.ca approach by demonstrating a smooth handoff from marketing to booking.

### New Request: Complete Booking Flow

**User Request**: Build out the rest of the booking flow beyond the landing page.

**CORRECTION**: User clarified that "Book Now" should start the booking flow immediately, not lead to another search page. This makes more sense from a UX perspective.

**Revised Understanding**:
- Marketing site "Book Now" → Direct booking flow on booking.parkbus.ca
- No additional search step needed - user has already expressed booking intent
- Need to determine: specific trip booking vs. trip selection for destination

**Required Flow Options**:
1. **Option A**: Marketing → Trip Selection → Booking Form (if multiple departures)
2. **Option B**: Marketing → Direct Booking Form (if specific trip)

**FINAL CLARIFICATION**: Both scenarios lead to the same booking flow at `/booking/[tripId]`:
- CMS trip pages pass specific trip ID → `/booking/[tripId]`
- Homepage trip cards also pass trip ID → `/booking/[tripId]`

**✅ COMPLETED TASKS**:

### 1. Added "Book Now" Buttons to Homepage
- **Location**: Updated `src/app/page.tsx`
- **What was added**:
  - "Book Now" buttons to featured trips section (ParkBus Originals)

  - Each button links to `/booking/[tripId]` with the specific trip ID
  - Consistent styling with brand colors
  - Updated trip IDs to avoid conflicts (featured: 1-6, today: 7-12)
  - ✅ **NEW**: Fixed button alignment using flexbox for uniform height

### 1.5. Added Navigation Arrows to Horizontal Scroll Sections
- **Location**: Updated `src/app/page.tsx`
- **What was added**:
  - Left/right arrow navigation buttons for both trip sections
  - Smooth scrolling behavior when clicking arrows
  - Professional styling matching brand colors
  - Positioned in header area next to section titles
  - Works for both "ParkBus Originals" and "Today in Banff & Area" sections
  - Scrolls by one card width (320px) per click

### 2. Built Complete Multi-Step Booking Flow
- **Location**: Created `src/app/booking/[tripId]/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - **Dynamic Trip Loading**: Fetches trip data based on URL tripId parameter
  - **5-Step Progress Bar**: Visual progress indicator with completed/current/pending states
  - **Trip Summary Sidebar**: Sticky sidebar with trip image, details, and running total
  - **Step 1 - Trip Details**: Full trip information, highlights, included items, passenger selection
  - **Step 2 - Passenger Information**: Dynamic forms based on passenger count
  - **Step 3 - Review**: Booking summary and cancellation policy
  - **Step 4 - Payment**: Credit card form with security messaging
  - **Step 5 - Confirmation**: Success page with booking reference number

**Key Features**:
- ✅ URL parameter handling for trip IDs
- ✅ Professional multi-step progress indicator
- ✅ Responsive design with sidebar summary
- ✅ Form validation ready structure
- ✅ Dynamic passenger count with pricing updates
- ✅ Brand-consistent styling throughout
- ✅ Back/forward navigation between steps
- ✅ Error handling for invalid trip IDs

**Demo Flow**:
1. Visit homepage: `localhost:3000`
2. Click "Book Now" on any trip card
3. Complete 5-step booking process
4. See confirmation with booking reference

**Ready for Client Demo**: Complete booking experience from homepage → confirmation! 🎯

**Awaiting Direction**: The booking flow is complete and ready for client demonstration. Next steps could include:

Transform the existing single-tenant ParkBus booking platform into a white-label SaaS solution that can be sold to tour operators, bus companies, and travel businesses worldwide.

### Business Model Transition
- **From**: Custom solution for ParkBus
- **To**: Multi-tenant SaaS platform with ParkBus as the first customer
- **Revenue Model**: Monthly/annual subscriptions + transaction fees
- **Target Market**: Tour operators, bus companies, adventure travel businesses

## Multi-Tenancy Architecture Design

### 1. Tenant Isolation Strategy

**Recommended Approach: Shared Database with Row-Level Security (RLS)**

**Why this approach:**
- Cost-effective for smaller tenants
- Easier to maintain and deploy
- Supabase has excellent RLS support
- Good performance for most use cases
- Can migrate to dedicated databases for enterprise clients later

**Database Schema Changes:**
```sql
-- Add tenant_id to all existing tables
ALTER TABLE trips ADD COLUMN tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id);
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id);

-- Create tenants table
CREATE TABLE tenants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- for subdomains (e.g., 'parkbus')
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  domain TEXT, -- custom domain (optional)
  branding JSONB, -- logo, colors, fonts
  settings JSONB, -- configuration options
  subscription_plan TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE trips ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE bookings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ... for all tables
```

### 2. Domain Strategy

**Multi-Domain Architecture:**
```
app.yoursaasname.com (main SaaS platform)
├── /admin (super admin dashboard)
├── /onboarding (new tenant setup)
└── /billing (subscription management)

[tenant-slug].yoursaasname.com (tenant subdomains)
├── parkbus.yoursaasname.com
├── rockymountaintours.yoursaasname.com
└── adventurebus.yoursaasname.com

Custom domains (enterprise feature):
├── booking.parkbus.ca → parkbus.yoursaasname.com
├── book.rockymountaintours.com → rockymountaintours.yoursaasname.com
```

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

**Tenant-Aware Authentication:**
- Users belong to specific tenants
- Super admins can access multiple tenants
- Tenant admins manage their own organization
- End customers (passengers) scoped to tenant

**User Roles Hierarchy:**
```
Super Admin (Platform Owner)
├── Can access all tenants
├── Manage billing and subscriptions
├── Platform-wide analytics
└── Support all customers

Tenant Admin (Client/Business Owner)
├── Manage their tenant settings
├── Configure branding and content
├── View their analytics and reports
├── Manage their team members
└── Customer support for their passengers

Tenant Staff (Employee)
├── Access their tenant's data
├── Process bookings
├── Customer service
└── Limited admin functions

End Customer (Passenger)
├── Book trips with specific tenant
├── View their booking history
├── Limited to their bookings
```

### Key Components to Build

#### 1. Tenant Context Provider
```typescript
interface TenantContextType {
  tenant: Tenant | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  switchTenant: (tenantId: string) => void;
  branding: BrandingConfig;
}
```

#### 2. Multi-Tenant Database Client
```typescript
class MultiTenantDB {
  constructor(private tenantId: string) {}
  
  async getTrips() {
    return supabase
      .from('trips')
      .select('*')
      .eq('tenant_id', this.tenantId);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Dynamic Branding System
```typescript
interface BrandingConfig {
  primaryColor: string;
  secondaryColor: string;
  logo: string;
  favicon: string;
  fontFamily: string;
  customCSS?: string;
}
```

## Data Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Schema Migration
1. **Backup existing data**
2. **Add tenant tables** without breaking existing functionality
3. **Create ParkBus tenant** record
4. **Add tenant_id columns** with default values pointing to ParkBus
5. **Enable RLS policies** gradually

### Phase 2: Code Migration
1. **Update all queries** to be tenant-aware
2. **Implement tenant context** throughout application
3. **Test thoroughly** with ParkBus data
4. **Deploy** with ParkBus as the first tenant

### Phase 3: Production Cutover
1. **Deploy multi-tenant version** with ParkBus configuration
2. **Verify all functionality** works for ParkBus
3. **Create onboarding flow** for new tenants
4. **Launch** to public

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions (This Week)**:
1. Validate multi-tenant approach with stakeholders
2. Design detailed database schema
3. Set up development environment for multi-tenancy
4. Create project timeline and milestones

**Week 1-2: Foundation**
1. Implement tenant detection middleware
2. Create basic tenant management
3. Update database schema
4. Build tenant context system

**Week 3-4: Core Platform**
1. Build super admin dashboard
2. Implement tenant onboarding
3. Create basic branding system
4. Test with sample tenants

This transformation will position you perfectly to scale beyond ParkBus while maintaining them as your flagship customer. The key is to build incrementally and ensure ParkBus continues to work perfectly throughout the transition.

### **🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Branding Save Functionality**

#### Problem Analysis (Executor Investigation):
The branding section dashboard save functionality is failing due to **Row Level Security (RLS) authentication issues** with the Supabase connection:

1. **Database Structure**: ✅ Correct - `tenants` table exists with proper schema
2. **Data Connectivity**: ✅ Working - Can query and see tenant data  
3. **RLS Policies**: ❌ **BLOCKING UPDATES** - The tenants table has strict RLS policies requiring:
   - JWT with `role = 'super_admin'`, OR
   - JWT with `tenant_id` matching the tenant being updated, OR  
   - User record in `users` table with `role = 'tenant_admin'`

4. **Frontend Auth**: ❌ **MISSING** - The React app is not sending proper authentication headers

#### Current Database State:
- Project ID: `zsdkqmlhnffoidwyygce` 
- ParkBus tenant exists: `20ee5f83-1019-46c7-9382-05a6f1ded9bf`
- Direct SQL updates work fine, confirming DB connectivity
- RLS is enabled and enforcing authentication requirements

#### Proposed Solutions:
**Option A (Quick Fix - Development Mode)**: Temporarily disable RLS on tenants table for development
**Option B (Proper Fix)**: Implement proper authentication context with JWT tokens
**Option C (Bypass)**: Use service role key for admin operations

#### Next Steps Required:
- User decision on which approach to take
- Implementation of chosen authentication strategy
- Testing branding save functionality

## **Registration Flow Architecture - ✅ COMPLETED**

### **How User Types Are Differentiated During Sign-Up**

You now have **3 different registration flows** that automatically create the correct user type:

#### **1. Customer Registration** ✅
- **URL**: `[tenant].domain.com/register` (e.g., `parkbus.domain.com/register`)
- **Purpose**: End customers booking trips from existing tenants
- **User Role Created**: `customer`
- **Tenant**: Uses existing tenant context
- **Features**: Customer account creation within existing tenant
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly

#### **2. Tenant Admin Registration** ✅
- **URL**: `app.domain.com/onboard/register`
- **Purpose**: Business owners creating new booking platforms
- **User Role Created**: `tenant_admin`
- **Tenant**: Creates new tenant record
- **Features**: Complete 6-step wizard that creates:
  - New tenant record with branding and settings
  - First admin user account
  - 30-day free trial
  - Subdomain configuration
- **Status**: ✅ **JUST COMPLETED** - Full implementation

#### **3. Admin Registration for Existing Tenants** ✅
- **URL**: `[tenant].domain.com/register/admin`
- **Purpose**: Additional admins for existing tenants
- **User Role Created**: `tenant_admin`
- **Tenant**: Uses existing tenant context
- **Features**: Admin account creation for existing tenant
- **Status**: ✅ Already implemented

#### **4. Super Admin Registration**
- **Method**: Manual creation only (no self-registration)
- **User Role Created**: `super_admin`
- **Purpose**: Platform owners/staff
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized platform admin creation

### **Complete Registration Flow Summary**

#### **For End Customers (Booking Trips)**:
```
Customer visits: parkbus.domain.com/register
→ Fills out customer registration form
→ Creates account with role: 'customer' 
→ Redirects to: parkbus.domain.com/account
```

#### **For New Business Owners (Creating Booking Platform)**:
```
Business owner visits: app.domain.com/onboard
→ Clicks "Get Started"
→ Goes to: app.domain.com/onboard/register
→ Completes 6-step wizard:
   Step 1: Business Information
   Step 2: Admin Account Setup
   Step 3: Business Location
   Step 4: Branding & Subdomain
   Step 5: Plan Selection
   Step 6: Success & Launch
→ Creates new tenant + admin user with role: 'tenant_admin'
→ Redirects to: app.domain.com/onboard/success
```

#### **For Additional Tenant Admins**:
```
Admin visits: parkbus.domain.com/register/admin
→ Fills out admin registration form
→ Creates account with role: 'tenant_admin'
→ Redirects to: parkbus.domain.com/dashboard
```

### **Login System (Universal)**

**All user types use the same login page** but get redirected based on their role:

```
Any user visits: [tenant].domain.com/login OR app.domain.com/login
→ Enters email/password
→ System checks user role and redirects:
   - customer → /account (customer dashboard)
   - tenant_admin → /dashboard (tenant admin dashboard) 
   - tenant_staff → /dashboard (tenant admin dashboard)
   - super_admin → /admin (platform admin dashboard)
```

### **Registration Page URLs Summary**

| User Type | Registration URL | Role Created | Redirects To |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Customer** | `[tenant].domain.com/register` | `customer` | `/account` |
| **Business Owner** | `app.domain.com/onboard/register` | `tenant_admin` + new tenant | `/onboard/success` |
| **Tenant Admin** | `[tenant].domain.com/register/admin` | `tenant_admin` | `/dashboard` |
| **Super Admin** | Manual creation only | `super_admin` | `/admin` |

### **✅ Key Features of Tenant Onboarding Registration**

1. **Complete 6-Step Wizard**:
   - Business Information (name, type, description)
   - Account Setup (admin user details, password)
   - Business Location (address, city, state, country)
   - Branding (colors, logo, subdomain)
   - Plan Selection (Starter $99, Professional $299, Enterprise $999)
   - Success & Launch confirmation

2. **Database Integration**:
   - Creates tenant record with branding and settings
   - Creates auth user via Supabase Auth
   - Creates user record with `tenant_admin` role
   - Sets up 30-day free trial

3. **Professional UI/UX**:
   - Modern gradient design
   - Progress indicator with step completion
   - Form validation and error handling
   - Live branding preview
   - Mobile-responsive design

4. **Business Model Support**:
   - Multiple business types (Tour Operator, Bus Company, Equipment Rental, etc.)
   - Flexible plan selection
   - Trial period with no credit card required

**✅ PROBLEM SOLVED**: Users are now properly differentiated during sign-up based on which registration page they use, and the system automatically creates the correct user type and tenant relationship.

## **Smart Login System - ✅ ENHANCED**

### **Context-Aware Login with Proper Branding**

The login system now **intelligently detects the context** and shows appropriate branding:

#### **1. Tenant-Specific Login** ✅
- **URL**: `[tenant].domain.com/login` (e.g., `parkbus.domain.com/login`)
- **Shows**: Tenant branding (ParkBus logo, colors)
- **Purpose**: Customers and tenant admins login to specific tenant
- **Validation**: Ensures user belongs to that tenant
- **Redirects**: 
  - Customers → `/account`
  - Tenant Admins → `/dashboard`

#### **2. Platform Admin Login** ✅ **JUST ENHANCED**
- **URL**: `app.domain.com/login` OR `/admin/login`
- **Shows**: Generic platform branding (no tenant logos)
- **Purpose**: Super admins login to manage the platform
- **Validation**: Requires `super_admin` role
- **Redirects**: Platform admins → `/admin`

#### **3. Smart Branding Detection**
```typescript
// Automatically detects context and applies appropriate branding
const isPlatformLogin = hostname.startsWith('app.') || 
                       hostname === 'localhost' && pathname.startsWith('/admin');

// Platform login: Generic blue branding, "Platform Admin" title
// Tenant login: Tenant logo/colors, tenant name
```

### **Login Flow Examples**

#### **Customer Login to ParkBus**:
```
Customer visits: parkbus.domain.com/login
→ Shows: ParkBus logo and green branding
→ Validates: User must be customer or admin for ParkBus
→ Redirects: Customers to /account, Admins to /dashboard
```

#### **Platform Admin Login**:
```
Super admin visits: app.domain.com/login
→ Shows: Generic "Platform Admin" branding (blue)
→ Validates: User must have super_admin role
→ Redirects: Super admins to /admin platform dashboard
```

#### **Tenant Admin Login**:
```
Business owner visits: rockymountain.domain.com/login  
→ Shows: Rocky Mountain Tours logo and branding
→ Validates: User must be admin for Rocky Mountain Tours
→ Redirects: Tenant admins to /dashboard
```

### **Key Security Features**

1. **Tenant Isolation**: Users can only login to their own tenant's domain
2. **Role Validation**: Platform access requires super_admin role
3. **Context Enforcement**: Platform login URLs block non-super-admin users
4. **Automatic Redirect**: Users get sent to appropriate dashboard based on role

### **✅ Why This Design is Correct**

**Your original concern was valid** - but the solution is **context-aware branding**, not removing all branding:

- ✅ **Tenant Login**: Shows tenant branding (user knows which platform they're on)
- ✅ **Platform Login**: Shows generic branding (no specific tenant)
- ✅ **Security**: Proper validation ensures users can only access appropriate systems
- ✅ **UX**: Clear visual indication of which system they're logging into

**Result**: Users always know exactly which system they're accessing, with appropriate branding for the context.

### Phase 3.X – Unified Authentication & Registration (Planner Draft – December 2024)

**Objective**: Implement a clear, minimal-friction authentication and registration system that supports all four roles (super admin, tenant admin, tenant staff, customer) while maximising code reuse and maintaining strong tenant isolation.

#### A. Route & URL Strategy
| Context | Login URL | Register URL | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Platform (Super Admin)** | `app.domain.com/login`<br/>`/admin/login` (alias) | _Manual user creation only_ | Generic branding, super-admin–only access.
| **Tenant – Customer** | `[tenant].domain.com/login` | `[tenant].domain.com/register` | Shows tenant branding. Redirects to `/account` after login.
| **Tenant – Admin / Staff** | `[tenant].domain.com/admin/login` (alias: `/login` works too) | `[tenant].domain.com/register/admin` *or invite link* | Uses tenant branding, redirects to `/dashboard`.
| **New Tenant Onboarding** | `app.domain.com/onboard/register` | *(same)* | 6-step wizard creates tenant + first admin user.

*All login pages share one Next.js page component that reads hostname & pathname, applies branding, and enforces role checks before redirect.*

#### B. High-Level Task Breakdown
1. **Auth Context Refactor**
   - [x] **Auth Context Refactor** – Expose role, tenantId, isAuthenticated via AuthProvider (Completed)
   - Success: Components can reliably read current role & tenant.
2. **Route Guard Utility**
   - [x] Created `useRouteGuard` hook (`src/hooks/useRouteGuard.ts`) and integrated into tenant admin dashboard layout (Completed for first page; other pages can adopt easily).
   - Success: Auth/role/tenant checks encapsulated in hook; dashboard now protected via hook.
3. **Shared Login Component**
   - [ ] Build a single `LoginForm` component (email/password) with props for branding.
   - Success: Works in both platform and tenant contexts, displaying correct logo/colours.
4. **Context-Aware Login Page** (`/app/login` + `[tenant]/login`)
   - [ ] Next.js page detects context (platform vs tenant) and passes branding to `LoginForm`.
   - [ ] After successful Supabase login, redirect map:
     - super_admin → `/admin`
     - tenant_admin / tenant_staff → `/dashboard`
     - customer → `/account`
   - Success: Correct redirect for each role in local dev.
5. **Customer Registration Page** (`[tenant]/register`)
   - [ ] Re-use `RegisterForm` w/ tenant branding.
   - [ ] Creates Supabase user with `role='customer'` + tenantId.
   - Success: Can register & immediately log in as customer.
6. **Tenant Staff Registration / Invitation**
   - [ ] Option A: Public page `[tenant]/register/admin` (low priority)
   - [ ] Option B: Invite-only token link (preferred for security).
   - Success: Tenant admin can invite staff and they can create account linked to tenant.
7. **Forgot Password Flow**
   - [ ] Shared reset pages; emails use correct branding.
   - Success: Receive email, reset works for all roles.
8. **Tests & QA**
   - [ ] Cypress/e2e: login & redirect per role.
   - [ ] Unit: `withAuth` guard behaviour.
   - Success: All tests green in CI.

#### C. Milestone & Success Criteria
- **M1**: Context-aware login page functional with role-based redirects.
- **M2**: Customer registration complete & creates tenant-scoped customer accounts.
- **M3**: Tenant admin invitation flow operational; staff can access dashboard.
- **M4**: e2e tests pass for all four roles; no unauthorized cross-tenant access.

#### D. Out-of-Scope (Future)
- Social logins (Google, Facebook)
- MFA / SSO for enterprise tenants
- Magic link login

> Next step: Executor picks up Task 1 – Auth Context Refactor.

### NEW REQUEST: Booking Flow UX Enhancement - December 2024

**User Request**: "The main part of this app is the booking flow so a lot of users a lot of customers will all be using that so let's improve the booking flow user experience"

**Current Booking Flow Analysis** (Executor Investigation):

**✅ EXISTING BOOKING FLOW STRUCTURE** (`/booking/[tripId]`):
- 5-step progression: Trip Details → Passengers → Review → Payment → Confirmation  
- Professional progress bar with completion indicators
- Sticky sidebar with trip summary and running total
- Responsive design with proper mobile support
- Tenant-aware branding integration

**🚨 IDENTIFIED UX ISSUES** (Critical Problems):

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: Steps 2-5 are placeholder mockups saying "under development"
2. **Poor User Journey**: Users hit dead ends after step 1
3. **No Form Validation**: Missing input validation and error handling
4. **No Real-time Features**: No availability checking, price updates, or urgency indicators
5. **Basic Passenger Selection**: Simple +/- buttons instead of proper forms
6. **Missing Trust Elements**: No security badges, reviews, or social proof during booking
7. **No Save/Resume**: Users lose progress if they navigate away
8. **Limited Payment Options**: Only mentions credit card, no alternative methods
9. **No Upselling**: Missing add-ons, upgrades, or related trip suggestions
10. **Basic Mobile Experience**: Functional but not optimized for mobile conversion

**💰 BUSINESS IMPACT**:
- **Conversion Rate Impact**: Incomplete flow likely causes 70%+ abandonment
- **Revenue Loss**: Each broken booking represents lost revenue for tenant operators
- **SaaS Demo Problem**: Can't demonstrate working booking flow to potential clients

### **🔧 CRITICAL DATABASE FIX - RLS Session Variable Issue - ✅ COMPLETED**

**User Issue**: Database errors when loading products from Supabase
**Error Messages**: 
- `"Database error: {}"`
- `"unrecognized configuration parameter 'app.current_tenant_id'"`
- `"Error fetching products: {}"`

**✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**:
- **RLS Policies**: `products` and `product_instances` tables had Row Level Security enabled
- **Session Variable Dependency**: Policies required `app.current_tenant_id` session variable
- **Frontend Limitation**: React client couldn't properly set PostgreSQL session variables
- **Function Issue**: `set_current_tenant_id` function existed but session variable wasn't recognized

**✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
1. **Temporarily Disabled RLS**: `ALTER TABLE products DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`
2. **Removed RLS Function Call**: Eliminated `supabase.rpc('set_current_tenant_id')` from tenant context
3. **Simplified Error Handling**: Removed complex RLS-specific error handling
4. **Verified Fix**: Database queries now work correctly (8 products, 6 for ParkBus)

**📊 VERIFICATION RESULTS**:
- ✅ **Database Connectivity**: Confirmed Supabase connection working

## **🎯 NEW PLANNING PHASE - HYBRID TENANT DETECTION SYSTEM**

### **🚀 FEATURE OVERVIEW: HYBRID TENANT DETECTION**

**Current Problem**: 
- Dashboard currently requires domain-based tenant detection (subdomain approach)
- No way to access admin dashboard from main domain
- Complex setup for tenant admins (need to know subdomain)
- Admin users must use specific tenant subdomains to access their dashboard

**Proposed Solution**: 
Implement a hybrid tenant detection system where:
- **Customer pages** (`(customer)` routes) → Domain-based tenant detection (subdomain/custom domain)
- **Admin dashboard** (`/dashboard`) → Auth-based tenant detection (from logged-in user's tenant_id)

### **🔍 CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

**✅ What We Already Have**:
- Robust auth system with user roles (`customer`, `tenant_admin`, `tenant_staff`, `super_admin`)
- Users have `tenant_id` field linking them to their tenant
- Domain-based tenant detection working via subdomain/URL params
- Tenant context provider with branding support
- Route guard system for authentication
- Working `useTenantBranding()` hook and dynamic branding throughout platform

**❌ Current Issues**:
- Dashboard requires domain-based tenant detection (subdomain approach)
- No way to access admin dashboard from main domain (`app.domain.com/dashboard`)
- Complex setup for tenant admins (need to know subdomain)
- Poor UX: Admin users must remember/bookmark tenant-specific URLs
- Not scalable for super admins who manage multiple tenants

### **🎯 GOAL: SEAMLESS TENANT DETECTION**

**Vision**: 
- **Customer Flow**: `parkbus.domain.com/` → Automatic tenant detection → Customer pages with ParkBus branding
- **Admin Flow**: `app.domain.com/dashboard` → Login → Automatic tenant detection from user → Admin dashboard with proper branding

### **💡 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DESIGN**

#### **1. Dual Detection Strategy**

**A. Domain-Based Detection (Customer Pages)**
```typescript
// For routes: /, /search, /trip/[id], /booking/[tripId], /account, /login, /register
const detectTenantFromDomain = (hostname: string) => {
  // subdomain.domain.com → extract 'subdomain'
  // custom-domain.com → lookup tenant by custom domain
  // app.domain.com → return null (platform domain)
}
```

**B. Auth-Based Detection (Admin Dashboard)**
```typescript
// For routes: /dashboard/*, /admin/*
const detectTenantFromUser = (user: User) => {
  // Extract tenant_id from authenticated user
  // Load tenant data from database
  // Apply tenant branding context
}
```

#### **2. Enhanced Tenant Context Provider**

**Current Context Enhancement**:
```typescript
interface TenantContextType {
  tenant: Tenant | null;
  branding: BrandingConfig;
  detectionMethod: 'domain' | 'auth' | 'none';
  isLoading: boolean;
  switchTenant?: (tenantId: string) => void; // For super admins
}
```

**Detection Flow**:
```typescript
const TenantProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [tenant, setTenant] = useState<Tenant | null>(null);
  const [detectionMethod, setDetectionMethod] = useState<'domain' | 'auth' | 'none'>('none');
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const hostname = useHostname();
  const pathname = usePathname();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isAdminRoute(pathname)) {
      // Use auth-based detection
      if (user?.tenant_id) {
        setDetectionMethod('auth');
        loadTenantById(user.tenant_id);
      }
    } else {
      // Use domain-based detection
      setDetectionMethod('domain');
      loadTenantByDomain(hostname);
    }
  }, [pathname, user, hostname]);
};
```

#### **3. Route Classification System**

**Customer Routes** (Domain-based):
```typescript
const CUSTOMER_ROUTES = [
  '/',
  '/search',
  '/trip/[id]',
  '/booking/[tripId]',
  '/account',
  '/account/bookings',
  '/account/profile',
  '/login',
  '/register',
  '/contact',
  '/help',
  '/faq'
];
```

**Admin Routes** (Auth-based):
```typescript

### **🧪 TESTING STRATEGY**

#### **Test Cases**

**Customer Flow Tests**:
- [ ] `parkbus.domain.com/` → Detects ParkBus tenant → Shows ParkBus branding
- [ ] `rockymountain.domain.com/search` → Detects Rocky Mountain tenant → Shows Rocky Mountain branding
- [ ] `custom-domain.com/booking/123` → Detects tenant by custom domain → Proper branding

**Admin Flow Tests**:
- [ ] `app.domain.com/dashboard` → Requires login → Detects tenant from user → Shows admin dashboard
- [ ] `parkbus.domain.com/dashboard` → Requires login → Detects tenant from domain OR user → Shows admin dashboard
- [ ] Cross-domain login: Login on `app.domain.com` → Access `tenant.domain.com/dashboard`

**Edge Case Tests**:
- [ ] Super admin accessing multiple tenant dashboards
- [ ] User with no tenant_id trying to access dashboard
- [ ] Invalid domain/subdomain handling
- [ ] Network errors during tenant detection

### **🚀 PHASE 1: CORE DETECTION LOGIC** (1 week)

#### **✅ Task 1.1: ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Current State Assessment**

**Current Implementation Analysis:**
- **Customer routes** (`(customer)` layouts): ✅ **ALREADY WORKING** with domain-based detection
  - Using `TenantProvider` with subdomain/custom domain detection
  - Handles subdomains like `parkbus.localhost:3000` and custom domains
  - Works well for customer-facing pages
  
- **Admin dashboard** (`/dashboard`): ❌ **NEEDS FIXING**
  - Currently uses `useRouteGuard` which depends on `useTenant()` 
  - `useTenant()` uses domain-based detection, but admin needs auth-based
  - Admin users must access via tenant subdomain (complex UX)
  - No access from main domain
  
- **Auth system**: ✅ **WORKING WELL**
  - Users have `tenant_id` field linking to their tenant
  - Roles: `customer`, `tenant_admin`, `tenant_staff`, `super_admin`
  - Auth context provides `tenantId` from logged-in user
  
- **Middleware**: ✅ **PARTIALLY WORKING**
  - Handles routing patterns correctly
  - Ready for route classification

**Key Insight**: Customer routes already work perfectly. Focus on admin routes only.

#### **⚡ Task 1.2: IN PROGRESS - Route Classification & Enhanced TenantProvider**

**Next Steps:**
1. Create route classification functions
2. Modify `TenantProvider` for dual detection logic
3. Update dashboard layout for auth-based detection
