# ParkBus Booking Site Development Plan

## Background and Motivation

The client has a marketing site at parkbus.ca built on Webflow with a CMS containing destination data. When users click "Book Now" on the marketing site, they should be redirected to a separate booking application at booking.parkbus.ca. This separation allows for:

- Clear separation of concerns between marketing and booking functionality
- Independent scaling and optimization of each platform
- Better user experience with a dedicated booking flow
- Easier maintenance and updates

**ðŸš€ NEW DIRECTION**: The platform is now being transformed from a single-client solution into a multi-tenant SaaS platform that can be sold to other tour/bus companies. This will require significant architectural changes while preserving the existing functionality for ParkBus.

## Current Technical Stack Analysis

**Existing Setup:**
- Next.js 15.3.3 with React 19
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for backend/database
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Radix UI components for accessible UI elements
- Lucide React for icons

**Existing Components:**
- `date-picker.tsx` - Date selection component
- `location-select.tsx` - Location/destination selector
- `passenger-selector.tsx` - Passenger count selection

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Completed Task: Demo Booking Landing Page

**What was built**: Created `/book` page that demonstrates the user experience when clicking "Book Now" from marketing site.

**Key Features**:
- URL parameter handling (`?destination=banff`, `?date=`, `?passengers=`)
- Hero section with destination-specific content and imagery
- Pre-populated search form integration
- Trust indicators for conversion
- Clean, focused booking interface
- Matches existing brand colors and styling

**Demo URLs to show client**:
- `booking.parkbus.ca/book?destination=banff`
- `booking.parkbus.ca/book?destination=jasper`
- `booking.parkbus.ca/book?destination=tofino`

**Success Criteria Met**:
âœ… Professional, conversion-focused landing page
âœ… URL parameter integration working
âœ… Existing search components integrated
âœ… Mobile-responsive design
âœ… Matches brand aesthetic

**Next Steps**: The demo page is ready to show your client. This should help convince them of the booking.parkbus.ca approach by demonstrating a smooth handoff from marketing to booking.

### New Request: Complete Booking Flow

**User Request**: Build out the rest of the booking flow beyond the landing page.

**CORRECTION**: User clarified that "Book Now" should start the booking flow immediately, not lead to another search page. This makes more sense from a UX perspective.

**Revised Understanding**:
- Marketing site "Book Now" â†’ Direct booking flow on booking.parkbus.ca
- No additional search step needed - user has already expressed booking intent
- Need to determine: specific trip booking vs. trip selection for destination

**Required Flow Options**:
1. **Option A**: Marketing â†’ Trip Selection â†’ Booking Form (if multiple departures)
2. **Option B**: Marketing â†’ Direct Booking Form (if specific trip)

**FINAL CLARIFICATION**: Both scenarios lead to the same booking flow at `/booking/[tripId]`:
- CMS trip pages pass specific trip ID â†’ `/booking/[tripId]`
- Homepage trip cards also pass trip ID â†’ `/booking/[tripId]`

**âœ… COMPLETED TASKS**:

### 1. Added "Book Now" Buttons to Homepage
- **Location**: Updated `src/app/page.tsx`
- **What was added**:
  - "Book Now" buttons to featured trips section (ParkBus Originals)
  - "Book Now" buttons to today's trips section (Today in Banff & Area)
  - Each button links to `/booking/[tripId]` with the specific trip ID
  - Consistent styling with brand colors
  - Updated trip IDs to avoid conflicts (featured: 1-6, today: 7-12)
  - âœ… **NEW**: Fixed button alignment using flexbox for uniform height

### 1.5. Added Navigation Arrows to Horizontal Scroll Sections
- **Location**: Updated `src/app/page.tsx`
- **What was added**:
  - Left/right arrow navigation buttons for both trip sections
  - Smooth scrolling behavior when clicking arrows
  - Professional styling matching brand colors
  - Positioned in header area next to section titles
  - Works for both "ParkBus Originals" and "Today in Banff & Area" sections
  - Scrolls by one card width (320px) per click

### 2. Built Complete Multi-Step Booking Flow
- **Location**: Created `src/app/booking/[tripId]/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - **Dynamic Trip Loading**: Fetches trip data based on URL tripId parameter
  - **5-Step Progress Bar**: Visual progress indicator with completed/current/pending states
  - **Trip Summary Sidebar**: Sticky sidebar with trip image, details, and running total
  - **Step 1 - Trip Details**: Full trip information, highlights, included items, passenger selection
  - **Step 2 - Passenger Information**: Dynamic forms based on passenger count
  - **Step 3 - Review**: Booking summary and cancellation policy
  - **Step 4 - Payment**: Credit card form with security messaging
  - **Step 5 - Confirmation**: Success page with booking reference number

**Key Features**:
- âœ… URL parameter handling for trip IDs
- âœ… Professional multi-step progress indicator
- âœ… Responsive design with sidebar summary
- âœ… Form validation ready structure
- âœ… Dynamic passenger count with pricing updates
- âœ… Brand-consistent styling throughout
- âœ… Back/forward navigation between steps
- âœ… Error handling for invalid trip IDs

**Demo Flow**:
1. Visit homepage: `localhost:3000`
2. Click "Book Now" on any trip card
3. Complete 5-step booking process
4. See confirmation with booking reference

**Ready for Client Demo**: Complete booking experience from homepage â†’ confirmation! ðŸŽ¯

**Awaiting Direction**: The booking flow is complete and ready for client demonstration. Next steps could include:
- Payment integration (Stripe/PayPal)
- Form validation and data persistence
- Email confirmation system
- User dashboard for managing bookings

## Lessons

- URL parameter parsing works well with Next.js useSearchParams hook
- Existing search components integrate seamlessly with destination-specific pages
- Hero sections with destination imagery help establish context for users coming from marketing site

# ðŸš€ MULTI-TENANT SAAS TRANSFORMATION PLAN

## Strategic Overview

Transform the existing single-tenant ParkBus booking platform into a white-label SaaS solution that can be sold to tour operators, bus companies, and travel businesses worldwide.

### Business Model Transition
- **From**: Custom solution for ParkBus
- **To**: Multi-tenant SaaS platform with ParkBus as the first customer
- **Revenue Model**: Monthly/annual subscriptions + transaction fees
- **Target Market**: Tour operators, bus companies, adventure travel businesses

## Multi-Tenancy Architecture Design

### 1. Tenant Isolation Strategy

**Recommended Approach: Shared Database with Row-Level Security (RLS)**

**Why this approach:**
- Cost-effective for smaller tenants
- Easier to maintain and deploy
- Supabase has excellent RLS support
- Good performance for most use cases
- Can migrate to dedicated databases for enterprise clients later

**Database Schema Changes:**
```sql
-- Add tenant_id to all existing tables
ALTER TABLE trips ADD COLUMN tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id);
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id);

-- Create tenants table
CREATE TABLE tenants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- for subdomains (e.g., 'parkbus')
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  domain TEXT, -- custom domain (optional)
  branding JSONB, -- logo, colors, fonts
  settings JSONB, -- configuration options
  subscription_plan TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE trips ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE bookings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ... for all tables
```

### 2. Domain Strategy

**Multi-Domain Architecture:**
```
app.yoursaasname.com (main SaaS platform)
â”œâ”€â”€ /admin (super admin dashboard)
â”œâ”€â”€ /onboarding (new tenant setup)
â””â”€â”€ /billing (subscription management)

[tenant-slug].yoursaasname.com (tenant subdomains)
â”œâ”€â”€ parkbus.yoursaasname.com
â”œâ”€â”€ rockymountaintours.yoursaasname.com
â””â”€â”€ adventurebus.yoursaasname.com

Custom domains (enterprise feature):
â”œâ”€â”€ booking.parkbus.ca â†’ parkbus.yoursaasname.com
â”œâ”€â”€ book.rockymountaintours.com â†’ rockymountaintours.yoursaasname.com
```

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

**Tenant-Aware Authentication:**
- Users belong to specific tenants
- Super admins can access multiple tenants
- Tenant admins manage their own organization
- End customers (passengers) scoped to tenant

**User Roles Hierarchy:**
```
Super Admin (Platform Owner)
â”œâ”€â”€ Can access all tenants
â”œâ”€â”€ Manage billing and subscriptions
â”œâ”€â”€ Platform-wide analytics
â””â”€â”€ Support all customers

Tenant Admin (Client/Business Owner)
â”œâ”€â”€ Manage their tenant settings
â”œâ”€â”€ Configure branding and content
â”œâ”€â”€ View their analytics and reports
â”œâ”€â”€ Manage their team members
â””â”€â”€ Customer support for their passengers

Tenant Staff (Employee)
â”œâ”€â”€ Access their tenant's data
â”œâ”€â”€ Process bookings
â”œâ”€â”€ Customer service
â””â”€â”€ Limited admin functions

End Customer (Passenger)
â”œâ”€â”€ Book trips with specific tenant
â”œâ”€â”€ View their booking history
â”œâ”€â”€ Limited to their bookings
```

### Key Components to Build

#### 1. Tenant Context Provider
```typescript
interface TenantContextType {
  tenant: Tenant | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  switchTenant: (tenantId: string) => void;
  branding: BrandingConfig;
}
```

#### 2. Multi-Tenant Database Client
```typescript
class MultiTenantDB {
  constructor(private tenantId: string) {}
  
  async getTrips() {
    return supabase
      .from('trips')
      .select('*')
